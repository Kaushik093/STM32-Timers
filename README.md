# STM32-Timers

## Objective
Develop a timer output compare driver to configure the timer on the STM32 MCU to control the GPIO pin, toggling an LED connected to the pin each time the timer reaches its timeout period.

### Refer to the design document in the repository for information on timers and how to develop code to use them.
